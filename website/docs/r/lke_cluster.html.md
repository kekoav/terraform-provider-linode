# linode\_lke_cluster

Manages an LKE cluster.

## Example Usage

Creating a basic LKE cluster:

```terraform
resource "linode_lke_cluster" "my-cluster" {
    label       = "my-cluster"
    k8s_version = "1.21"
    region      = "us-central"
    tags        = ["prod"]

    pool {
        type  = "g6-standard-2"
        count = 3
    }
}
```

Creating an LKE cluster with autoscaler:

```terraform
resource "linode_lke_cluster" "my-cluster" {
    label       = "my-cluster"
    k8s_version = "1.21"
    region      = "us-central"
    tags        = ["prod"]

    pool {
        type  = "g6-standard-2"
        count = 3

        autoscaler {
          min = 3
          max = 10
        }
    }
}
```

## Argument Reference

The following arguments are supported:

* `label` - (Required) This Kubernetes cluster's unique label.

* `k8s_version` - (Required) The desired Kubernetes version for this Kubernetes cluster in the format of `major.minor` (e.g. `1.17`), and the latest supported patch version will be deployed.

* `region` - (Required) This Kubernetes cluster's location.

* [`pool`](#pool) - (Required) The Node Pool specifications for the Kubernetes cluster. At least one Node Pool is required.

* [`control_plane`](#control_plane) (Optional) Defines settings for the Kubernetes Control Plane.

* `tags` - (Optional) An array of tags applied to the Kubernetes cluster. Tags are for organizational purposes only.

### pool

The following arguments are supported in the `pool` specification block:

* `type` - (Required) A Linode Type for all of the nodes in the Node Pool. See all node types [here](https://api.linode.com/v4/linode/types).

* `count` - (Required) The number of nodes in the Node Pool.

* [`autoscaler`](#autoscaler) - (Optional) If defined, an autoscaler will be enabled with the given configuration.

* `tags` - (Optional) An array of tags applied to the Node Pool. Tags are for organizational purposes only.

* [`disk`](#disk) - (Optional) An array of custom partitions to create on each node, in addition to the boot partition.


### autoscaler

The following arguments are supported in the `autoscaler` specification block:

* `min` - (Required) The minimum number of nodes to autoscale to.

* `max` - (Required) The maximum number of nodes to autoscale to.

### control_plane

The following arguments are supported in the `control_plane` specification block:

* `high_availability` - (Optional) Defines whether High Availability is enabled for the cluster Control Plane. This is an **irreversible** change. **NOTICE:** High Availability Control Planes are currently available through early access. To learn more, see the [early access documentation](https://github.com/linode/terraform-provider-linode/tree/master/EARLY_ACCESS.md).

### disk

This Node Pool’s custom disk layout. Each item in this array will create a new disk partition for each node in this Node Pool.

The custom disk layout is applied to each node in this Node Pool.  The maximum number of custom disk partitions that can be configured is 7. Once the requested disk paritions are allocated, the remaining disk space is allocated to the node’s boot disk.
A Node Pool’s custom disk layout is immutable over the lifetime of the Node Pool.

* `size` - (Required) The size of this custom disk partition in MB.
* `type` - (Required) This custom disk partition’s filesystem type. One of: `raw` `ext4`.

## Attributes Reference

In addition to all arguments above, the following attributes are exported:

* `id` - The ID of the cluster.

* `status` - The status of the cluster.

* `api_endpoints` - The endpoints for the Kubernetes API server.

* `kubeconfig` - The base64 encoded kubeconfig for the Kubernetes cluster.

* `pool` - Additional nested attributes:

  * `id` - The ID of the Node Pool.

  * [`nodes`](#nodes) - The nodes in the Node Pool.

### nodes

The following attributes are available on nodes:

* `id` - The ID of the node.

* `instance_id` - The ID of the underlying Linode instance.

* `status` - The status of the node. (`ready`, `not_ready`)

## Import

LKE Clusters can be imported using the `id`, e.g.

```sh
terraform import linode_lke_cluster.my_cluster 12345
```
